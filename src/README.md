I created my wireframe by hand but decided to do a digital one for perspective sake, 
which turn out for the best truthfully speaking, since my vision changed while actually getting into the project. 
I learned about the <b>Bold Tag</b> in this process along with getting a better understanding of state and props passing. 
I also have three more components to finish working on, along with a still incomplete players page.
